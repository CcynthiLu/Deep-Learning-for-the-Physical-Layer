# Deep-Learning-for-the-Physical-Layer
PyTorch implementation for part of paper "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer" by Kenta Iwasaki on behalf of Gram.AI.


Requirement::
python3 pytorch

I re-implement two experiments in this paper:


 singleuser.py simulates single user encoder-adding noise-decoder steps..
 
 
 twouser.py simulates two user transmission..
 
 
 Note:results sames to be different compred to figure in paper. be careful!!!!!
