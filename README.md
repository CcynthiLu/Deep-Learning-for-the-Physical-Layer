# Deep-Learning-for-the-Physical-Layer
PyTorch implementation for part of paper "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer" by Kenta Iwasaki on behalf of Gram.AI.
I re-implement two experiments in this paper:
 singleuser.py simulate single user encoder-adding noise-decoder steps..
 twouser.py simulate two user transmission..
 Note:results sames to be different compred to figure in paper. be careful!!!!!
